# cellularautomaton
A simple little program that steps through a cellular automaton in your terminal. If you're not a Windows user it should a) wo0rk and b) show color; I haven't figured out how to make it show color on Windows machines, although I have some ideas. In the future you should be able to write the rules of the cellular automaton and run this program with those rules; right now, for any given cell the next value equals the old value, minus one, plus one for every positive orthogonal neighbor. This makes it "ripple." Oh, and it's decimal, with values higher than nine wrapping around.
